# 🎨 Unified UI/UX Strategy: "Lumina Prime"

## 🌟 Vision
To transform Progress LMS into a **state-of-the-art educational ecosystem** that feels premium, energetic, and highly intuitive. The "Lumina Prime" strategy focuses on **depth**, **illumination**, and **unified visual language** across all user roles.

---

## 🎨 Educational Theme: "Vibrant Academy"

### 1. Visual Metaphors
- **Illumination**: Success and progress are represented by subtle glows and light-emitting elements.
- **Glassmorphism**: Using frosted glass textures (`backdrop-blur`) to create a sense of depth and modern layering.
- **3D Assets**: High-quality 3D digital illustrations for key touchpoints (Login, Empty States, Milestones).

### 2. Unified Color Strategy
- **Base**: Off-white/Slate backgrounds (`bg-slate-50`) for maximum content clarity.
- **Students (Energy)**: Amber (#F59E0B) to Orange (#EA580C) gradients.
- **Teachers (Growth)**: Teal (#0D9488) to Cyan (#0891B2) gradients.
- **Admins (Authority)**: Indigo (#4F46E5) to Purple (#9333EA) gradients.
- **Super Admins (Control)**: Obsidian (#1E293B) to Zinc (#3F3F46) gradients.
